                My professional journey started as a Junior Data Analyst with <a href={''} id='text-link'>Belmont Data Collaborative</a>, a university-affiliated startup. This role allowed me to explore cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions in a vibrant environment. It was here that I truly grasped how data can shape business strategies and operations, and I began to appreciate how data narrates a story and impacts our daily lives. Driven to deepen my technical expertise, I then took on a Data Analyst Intern position at <a href={''} id='text-link'>Urban Science</a>. Here, I had the opportunity to tackle complex data challenges within the automotive industry, refining my skills in <strong><i>SQL and Python</i></strong>, developing models, and conducting predictive analytics. Eventually, my passion for technology and problem-solving led me to transition into Software Engineering, where I could leverage my analytical background in new and impactful ways.
